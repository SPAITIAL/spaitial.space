Home of the data for the 3D force-directed graph explaining "What is spatial AI?" on http://spaitial.space

Gotchas in editing the graph data:
- Avoid ampersands. I should be able to URLescape them later, but for now - get creative!
- Don't worry about metadata (group, URL, etc)
- Trailing comma on last line. Breaks things.

With thanks to the amazing [Vasco Asturiano](https://github.com/vasturiano) for his work on 3D-force-directed graphs.
